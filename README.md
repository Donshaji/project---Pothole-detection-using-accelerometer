# project---Pothole-detection-using-accelerometer
Final year main project

using IoT devices , detecting potholes on the road
When a vehicle falls on a pothole there is a sudden change in the acceleration. In a normal case, the Z-axis acceleration is 1g(9.8 newton meters per second). But in this case is even higher like 2-3 g, and the device can detect it, using the GPS module the location data is also combined and sent using GSM module

Analyizing the data send by the device, and find which location have more bad roads, thus passenges can avoid or take percautions.

-We are also planing to make a app that can detect potholes(smart phones have in build accelerometer)
-Build a plugin for google map overlay to show road quality
